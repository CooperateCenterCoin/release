Cooperate.Center Coin background:
People don't know what finance instrument is good and in what invest so pay for investment and for managing it, even if they don't need to. As people as themselves bring value to the project.
This concept is simple - people are people so they can add user experience to the project which they founding. They know the market as they are the market.
Cooperate.Center Coin is not just a Coin for development Cooperate.Center. In Contract 2 it is mentioned that funds can be used for development on related to Cooperate.Center project to bring some functionality. Functionality is wider definition than app or dapp it is more it is also hardware or complementary software.  The truth is that only 20 000 000 tokens less than 1/5 is dedicated to strongly related to cooperate.center development. As awards for activity and so on are.
Cooperate.Center is a hub to deploy DAO which meets current needs of CC Coin users. DAO to decide what software, app, dapp, or hardware develop, and those decisions will be driven by user needs, user desires and user experience and execute accurate to users _decisions_. Yes cooperate.center will be not administrate the users but users will administrate cooperate.center for their needs and desires.   
Important to read before invest is Contracts to read is Contract 1 and Contract 2 , contract 1 is on main network along with Coins code. The related contract and regulation are also on blockchain but due to recent implement gas limit restriction on FronTier those contracts are deployed on Morden network. As archive it is correct to Akasha concept. 1 blockchain for critical information and code, second blockchain for archive and documentary purpose.
Important to use cooperate.center are all contracts listed.
The law and tax issues and solution are implemented.
Be aware that You don't buy company shares and you don't buy unit of invest fund.  
Backup for Coins _miners work_ is in content and intellectual property which users will demand to develop. So there is a backup plan but it is not executed, so there is no assets related to Coin during its purchase.
 
If you want to test Coin I can provide you some test Tokens. on Mordern.
DAO frameworks before deployment will be also tested on Mordern network before live release.
1 Token donation is 0,34 $ you may buy it through paypal barnabapa@weeurocitizens.org provide your etheradress best within transaction or by email to contact@cooperate.center
Tokens emission is 108000001 and there will be no more to donate for.
Minimal 1 Token donation may only go up according to contract 1 and 2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little bit about cooperate.center approach to provide _proper_ law frames.

Main AIM of this project is to gather data about efficiency (number of users in time) of gathering people around project which may affect and benefit their lives.
Some anonymized data might be used in my PhD papers mostly in forms of stats.
Project is simple so almost everybody can participate.
This is scientific experiment in some countries some laws might no apply.
This project is about: Groups, collaboration, aims, self development, love, hate, hate groups and perception of self, evolution of groups and projects, project management, ads and organizers affecting time perception. Time. Training. Concentration.
Moderation will be reduced to absolute minimum about posting not legal porn or snuff films and illegal stuff which will be reported to be deleted.
Please report not legal content here: notlegal@barnabapa.pl with link within email.
This experiment is for mature people which can perform their own act of will in legal terms.
Some interface features might be paid.

Be nice and polite to each other.
Best Wishes.
Barney .P.
